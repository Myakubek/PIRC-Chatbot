# PIRC-Chatbot 
This project uses the [PircBot java framework](http://www.jibble.org/pircbot.php) to create an IRC bot, The bot pulls json information from REST API's and parses them using gson.

Weather information is pulled off [open weather map's API](https://openweathermap.org/API) 

Bitcoin information is pulled off [coindesk's API](https://api.coindesk.com/v1/bpi/currentprice.json)
